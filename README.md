# Sock Calculator

I'm tired of doing calculations and I wanted to try building something with [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) and [Lustre](https://hexdocs.pm/lustre/index.html). The result: a simple calculator that generates sock knitting instructions for any desired stitch count.

Currently only supports one type of sock and one type of heel, but more to follow, maybe?
